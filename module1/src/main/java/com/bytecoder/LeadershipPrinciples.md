## **1. Resume & Background Discussion**

### **Q: Walk me through your resume.**
👉 **Answer:**  
"I have around **5 years of experience in software development**. I started with **Java and Spring Boot** for backend development, and later transitioned to **React.js** for frontend work. More recently, I’ve been working as a **Node.js backend developer**, focusing on scalable APIs and microservices.

I also have experience in **Big Data engineering**, particularly with **PySpark** for data processing. This mix of backend development and distributed computing has given me strong problem-solving skills, especially in optimizing performance and scalability.

Currently, I’m working on a backend-heavy project
where I develop APIs in Java , focusing on efficiency and reliability and secured.
- Also handling big data  
I’ve also been exploring **thread-safe collections** in Java and working with **pagination solutions** in FastAPI for scalable database queries.

I am actively preparing for system design and **DSA (especially string-related questions in Java)**, and I’m excited about the opportunity at Meta because of its focus on cutting-edge distributed systems and large-scale data processing."

"I’ve worked on a variety of backend-heavy projects, including:
- **Scalable APIs**: Developed RESTful APIs in Java (Spring Boot) and Node.js, ensuring efficient data retrieval and processing.
- **Big Data Pipelines**: Built ETL pipelines using **PySpark** for batch and real-time data processing.
- **High-Performance Distributed Systems**: Optimized large-scale data operations with efficient memory management and caching strategies.
- **Thread-Safe Processing**: Implemented **ConcurrentHashMap** and thread-safe patterns in Java for performance improvements.
- **Pagination & Query Optimization**: Designed reusable pagination solutions in **FastAPI** to improve database query performance."

---

### **Q: What technologies do you have the most experience with?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"My primary expertise lies in **backend development** with:
- **Java & Spring Boot** (3 years) – REST APIs, microservices
- **Node.js** (recent experience) – Scalable backend systems
- **PySpark** (2 years) – Big data processing, ETL pipelines
- **React.js** (past experience) – Frontend development
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Caching & Concurrency**: Redis, ConcurrentHashMap"

---

### **Q: Why are you interested in Meta?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"I’m particularly interested in Meta because of its focus on **scalability, distributed systems, and high-performance computing**. Given my experience in **building scalable APIs, handling big data with PySpark, and working on multi-threaded backend systems**, I feel my skill set aligns well with Meta’s backend engineering challenges.

I also admire Meta’s **culture of innovation and impact-driven engineering**, and I’m excited about the opportunity to work on **large-scale, cutting-edge backend systems** that power billions of users."

---

## **2. Meta Interview Process & Expectations**

### **Q: Have you worked on large-scale distributed systems?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"Yes, I have worked on **distributed data processing systems using PySpark**, where we handled large datasets efficiently. I’ve also worked on **backend microservices** that communicate asynchronously using Kafka.

In my Java backend work, I’ve optimized **multi-threaded operations with ConcurrentHashMap** to handle concurrent requests in a distributed environment."

---

## **3. Basic Technical Screening Questions**

### **Q: What programming languages are you most comfortable with?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"My strongest languages are **Java, Python (PySpark), and JavaScript (Node.js)**.

- I use **Java** for backend API development and system design.
- **Python with PySpark** for big data processing and performance tuning.
- **Node.js** for building fast, scalable backend applications."

---

### **Q: Have you worked with algorithms and data structures?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"Yes, I actively practice **data structures and algorithms**, especially in Java. I’ve been focusing on **string manipulation, trees, graphs, and concurrency-related problems**, as they are relevant to my backend work."

---

### **Q: How do you approach debugging a production issue?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"My debugging approach includes:
1. **Reproducing the issue** in a controlled environment.
2. **Checking logs and monitoring tools** (e.g., ELK, Datadog) to pinpoint failures.
3. **Analyzing recent code changes** to find regressions.
4. **Using breakpoints & debugging tools** for deeper insights.
5. **Rolling back or deploying a hotfix** if necessary."

---

### **Q: Have you done system design before?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"Yes, I have designed **scalable backend systems** with:
- **Microservices architecture** in Java & Node.js
- **Database design** for high-performance queries
- **Caching (Redis) & Load Balancing (Nginx, AWS ALB)**
- **Asynchronous processing (Kafka, RabbitMQ)**

I’m currently enhancing my **system design skills** to be better prepared for large-scale architecture discussions."

---

## **4. Logistics & Timeline**

### **Q: Are you actively interviewing elsewhere?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"I am in the early stages of my job search and exploring opportunities at companies like Meta that focus on backend engineering and scalable systems."

---

### **Q: What is your expected salary range?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"I’m open to discussing compensation based on the role, level, and expectations. Could you share the range Meta offers for this position?"

---

### **Q: Are you open to relocation?**
👉 **Answer:**

---

### **Q: When can you start if offered?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"I would need to serve a notice period of [X] weeks at my current job, but I am open to discussions based on Meta’s timeline."

---

## **5. Behavioral Questions (Meta’s Leadership Principles)**

### **Q: Tell me about a time you worked in a high-pressure environment.**
👉 **Answer:**  
"In my previous role, we had a **critical production issue** where a backend service handling millions of requests per hour started failing.

I quickly:
1. **Identified the root cause** using logs and APM tools.
2. **Implemented a temporary fix** by rolling back a faulty deployment.
3. **Designed a long-term solution** by adding better exception handling and autoscaling.

This experience taught me how to stay calm, prioritize issues, and work collaboratively under pressure."

---

### **Q: How do you handle disagreements in a team?**
👉 **Answer:**  
"I focus on **data-driven discussions and empathy**.

For example, in a past project, we disagreed on **whether to use a SQL or NoSQL database**. Instead of debating, I proposed:
- Running **benchmarks** based on our workload.
- Comparing read/write performance & scalability.
- Choosing the best option based on real-world data.

This approach helped us make an informed decision while maintaining a positive team dynamic."
