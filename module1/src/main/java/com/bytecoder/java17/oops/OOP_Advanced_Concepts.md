### Composition vs Inheritance

- Favor composition over inheritance
- Benefits:
  - More flexible design
  - Avoids tight coupling
  - Easier to modify behavior at runtime
- When to use inheritance:
  - True "is-a" relationships
  - When extending framework classes
  - When polymorphic behavior is needed

### Design by Contract

- Preconditions
- Postconditions
- Invariants
- Implementation in Java using assertions and documentation

### Object Lifecycle

- Creation patterns
- Initialization blocks
- Constructor chaining
- Cleanup and finalization
- Resource management (try-with-resources)

### Advanced Inheritance Concepts

- Multiple inheritance through interfaces
- Default methods in interfaces
- Abstract classes vs interfaces
- Diamond problem and its solutions

### Polymorphism Deep Dive

- Static vs Dynamic binding
- Method overloading resolution
- Virtual method invocation
- Double dispatch and visitor pattern
