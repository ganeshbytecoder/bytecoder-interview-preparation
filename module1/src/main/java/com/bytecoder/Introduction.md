**Fourkites -

- i started my career with hashedin by delloite as a intern and later on i was converted to full time software engineer.
- after that i join a project call fourkites, where was building a microservice for the client. this project was to onboard their logistic partners and carrier.
- so Borkers/their partner can track their shipments. as part of this project i used aws, spring boot and postgres etc and delivered with happy customer satisfaction
- this microservice was like building carieer network and see all their shipments at one place without check to different portals

**FinTech Microservices Infrastructure Migration & Standardization**

- **FinTech Domain & Requirements Gathering**Joined a FinTech project supporting 40+ microservices, where I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to understand and document each service’s requirements. This involved creating standardized documentation and best-practice guidelines that were adopted across all teams, ensuring consistent processes and streamlined development.
- **Infrastructure Migration & Modernization**As part of the core infrastructure migration team, I proposed and implemented changes to meet new infrastructure requirements—ranging from architectural improvements to security enhancements. This included updating service configurations in Consul (service discovery) and HashiCorp Vault, then rigorously testing those updates in lower environments before production rollout.
- **Scalability & Standardization**To ensure our platform could scale efficiently, I led the effort to Dockerize 40+ microservices following best practices for environment-agnostic builds. I integrated these services with Kubernetes for orchestration, set up AWS-based CI/CD pipelines, and leveraged Terraform and Helm for infrastructure-as-code. These improvements laid the foundation for reliable, repeatable deployments while reducing downtime and manual intervention.
- **Security & Observability**Emphasized security at every layer: enforcing IAM role-based access in AWS, restricting services to private subnets, and managing secrets via HashiCorp Vault.
