**Problem** Given an array of strings strs[]. The task is to return the longest common prefix among each and every strings present in the array. If there’s no prefix common in all the strings, return “-1”.

Hint: 
* Longest Common Prefix using Sorting


**Problem** Given two strings s1 and s2, find if the first string is a Subsequence of the second string, i.e. if s1 is a subsequence of s2.  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```
Input: s1 = “AXY”, s2 = “ADXCPY”
Output: True 
All characters of s1 are in s2 in the same order


Input: s1 = “AXY”, s2 = “YADXCP”
Output: False 
All characters are present, but order is not same.
```

Hint:
* Using Recursion:
* Iterative Solution:


**Problem**: Check if a string is substring of another
```
Input: S1 = “for”, S2 = “geeksforgeeks”
Output: 5
Explanation: String “for” is present as a substring of s2.


Input: S1 = “practice”, S2 = “geeksforgeeks”
Output: -1.
Explanation: There is no occurrence of “practice” in “geeksforgeeks”
```
