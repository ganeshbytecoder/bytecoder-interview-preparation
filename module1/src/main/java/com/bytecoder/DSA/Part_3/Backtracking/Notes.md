### **Backtracking Problems:**

1. **Rat in a Maze Problem**
   - Use backtracking to explore all possible paths from the start to the destination, marking visited paths and backtracking if a path leads to a dead end.

2. **Printing All Solutions in N-Queen Problem**
   - Use backtracking to place queens on the board. Ensure that no two queens threaten each other before placing the next queen.

3. **Word Break Problem Using Backtracking**
   - Use backtracking to check all possible partitions of the string and see if each partition is a valid word in the dictionary.

4. **Remove Invalid Parentheses**
   - Use backtracking to generate all possible expressions by removing invalid parentheses, then check if they are valid.

5. **Sudoku Solver**
   - Use backtracking to fill empty cells with digits while ensuring that the current placement does not violate Sudoku rules.

6. **m Coloring Problem**
   - Use backtracking to assign colors to each vertex, ensuring no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

7. **Print All Palindromic Partitions of a String**
   - Use backtracking to explore all possible partitions of the string and check if each partition is a palindrome.

8. **Subset Sum Problem**
   - Use backtracking to explore all subsets of the array, and track the subsets that sum to a given value.

9. **The Knight’s Tour Problem**
   - Use backtracking to move the knight on the chessboard, ensuring each move is valid and backtracking if no further moves are possible.

10. **Tug of War**
   - Use backtracking to divide the array into two subsets of nearly equal sum, minimizing the difference between the sums.

11. **Find Shortest Safe Route in a Path with Landmines**
   - Use backtracking to explore all possible routes, ensuring that no landmines are encountered.

12. **Combinational Sum**
   - Use backtracking to generate all combinations of numbers that sum to the target value, allowing repeated use of elements.

13. **Find Maximum Number Possible by Doing At-Most K Swaps**
   - Use backtracking to explore all possible digit swaps, keeping track of the maximum number formed.

14. **Print All Permutations of a String**
   - Use backtracking to generate all permutations of the string by swapping characters and reverting swaps.

15. **Find if There is a Path of More Than K Length from a Source**
   - Use backtracking to explore all paths and track the length of each path.

16. **Longest Possible Route in a Matrix with Hurdles**
   - Use backtracking to explore all routes in the matrix, keeping track of the longest valid route.

17. **Print All Possible Paths from Top Left to Bottom Right of an mXn Matrix**
   - Use backtracking to explore all possible paths from the start to the destination in the matrix.

18. **Partition of a Set into K Subsets with Equal Sum**
   - Use backtracking to partition the array into `K` subsets such that each subset has the same sum.

19. **Find the K-th Permutation Sequence of First N Natural Numbers**
   - Use backtracking to generate permutations, and keep track of the `K-th` permutation.
