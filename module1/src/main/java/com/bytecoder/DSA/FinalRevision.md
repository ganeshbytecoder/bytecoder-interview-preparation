## 8. 📘 Java-Specific Notes & Snippets

### Arrays & Lists
```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
List<Integer> list = Arrays.stream(arr).boxed().toList();
Collections.reverse(list); // in-place reverse
```

### Characters to List
```java
char[] chars = "list".toCharArray();
List<Character> charList = new ArrayList<>();
for (char c : chars) charList.add(c);
```

### Convert 2D Arrays to List of Lists
```java
int[][] grid = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
List<List<Integer>> list2D = Arrays.stream(grid)
    .map(row -> Arrays.stream(row).boxed().toList())
    .toList();
```

### Frequency Count Using Map
```java
Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
for (int num : nums) freqMap.put(num, freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
```
