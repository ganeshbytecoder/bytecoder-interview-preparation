## **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Variants**
1. **[Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)** - Classic DP with memoization.
2. **[Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)** - DP table to compute min edit operations.
3. **[Distinct Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/)** - Count distinct subsequences using DP.
4. **[Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings/)** - DP to compute minimum delete cost for equal strings.
- 🔹 **[1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/) (Medium)**  
  Find the length of the longest subsequence common to two strings.

- 🔹 **[1035. Uncrossed Lines](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncrossed-lines/) (Medium)**  
  Similar to LCS but applied to arrays.
